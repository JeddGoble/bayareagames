## Games made in the Bay
This is still very much a work in progress, the goal is to collect and highlight games made locally.

We will make an attempt with these: 
- [Bay Area Games Steam curator page](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36601108/)
- [Bay Area Games itch.io collection](https://itch.io/c/710382/bay-area-games)

Scratch work on this [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I7c4o3j6JmOSwsa2o1TE3I8bFZoYsXvZvz9Oh1zIgpE/edit#gid=1866587470)

Find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tyVV4Wa) if you have ideas or want to join the curating group!
