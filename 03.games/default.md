## Games made in the Bay
This is still very much a work in progress, the goal is to collect and highlight games made locally.
I will make an attempt with these: 
- [Bay Area Games Steam curator page](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36601108/)(still empty)
- [Bay Area Games itch.io collection](https://itch.io/c/710382/bay-area-games)

And maybe a google spreadsheet.

Find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tyVV4Wa) if you have ideas or want to join the curating group!
